**Live Website:** (https://the-spotter-2.onrender.com/) 

The Spotter is an interactive platform built from the ground up for gym enthusiasts. It allows users to register, log in, and contribute to a growing database of gyms. Each listing features detailed information, user-submitted reviews, photo galleries, and an interactive map showing its precise location.

The project demonstrates a complete development lifecycle with a secured backend API, a responsive UI, and a comprehensive test suite for both backend logic(Jest) and frontend user flows(Playwright).
